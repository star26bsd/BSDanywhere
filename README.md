BSDanywhere
===========

Code dump of the former BSDanywhere project - the OpenBSD Live CD.

While the BSDanywhere project has been terminated years ago, I wanted the code to survive somewhere. It may serve as a starting point for anyone who's interested in starting a similar (or totally different) project. BSDanywhere uses a build.sh script to fetch OpenBSD filesets and build a clean CD image from any OpenBSD installation (in contrast to dumping a pre-configured machine to an image). Watch a quick demo at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vo8UD9psRw

This repository has been converted from subversion so it may lack certain git fancyness.

Enjoy,
Stephan
